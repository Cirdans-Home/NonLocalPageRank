%% linkprediction.m Tester for the Nonlocal PageRank linkprediction
% This tester reproduces the performances of the non-local pagerank on the
% problem of predicting the edges of a given graph (digraph) G. Namely, we
% suppose having a snapshot of the graph (digraph) G at time t0, and we
% know that at time t1 a new graph (digraph) G' will need to be computed in
% such way that G and G' have the same nodes, but some edges will have been
% added to G. To test the performances the present code will start from a
% graph (digraph) G, and will remove a chosen amount of edges from it, than
% the heuristic algorithm will try to guess what edges to add. A score
% based on the number of correctedly guessed links is then produced.
